				<h3 class="pressH3">Sacramento Region business owners gain a new outsourced HR solution with opening of consultancy firm, HR Done Right.</h3>
				<p class="pressEM">Small business centric Region now has an hourly HR option, complimentary 60-minute consultations.</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="pressStrong">Sacramento, CA - January 28, 2016</strong> - Award winning local employee benefits brokerage, Benefits Done Right, launches &ldquo;sister company&rdquo;, HR Done Right, this month to provide comprehensive human resource services.
				</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Small businesses dominate in the four-county Sacramento region. Nearly <strong>98 percent</strong> are considered small businesses, and a further 75 percent are considered microbusinesses.&rdquo; (Sacramento Business Journal)</p>
				
				<p>Outsourcing human resource (HR) services provides small businesses with the benefits of an in-house HR professional without the overhead costs of a full-time employee. These services are increasingly popular and will now be available from an additional firm in the Sacramento region - HR Done Right.</p>
				<p>In an ever-changing compliance heavy environment (think Family and Medical Leave Act, Americans with Disabilities Act and the Affordable Care Act), partnering with an HR firm to do the HR &ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo; allows employers to focus on their core business goals. </p>
				<p>HR Done Right will <strong>uniquely provide complimentary 60-minute consultations</strong> and a variety of pricing structures, <strong>including an hourly fee option</strong>, which will likely appeal to many small businesses in the Region.</p>
				<p>
				<strong>Business leaders are invited to HR Done Right&rsquo;s free educational launch event, <em>Three Things Employers and HR Leaders Need to Know in the New Year</em>
				</strong>, on February 17 at 4:30 pm in Sacramento. Leading employment attorneys from Ellis Buhler Makus will discuss social media privacy, the Equal Pay Act and new considerations for working with contractors. Space is limited. RSVP to 888-805-5421.</p>
